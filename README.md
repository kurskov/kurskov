### Hello, I’m Dmitrii Kurskov.
IT-industry is a hobby for me, but sometime is be helpful for my work and live.  
Back in 1997 I created my first program in Pascal to solve the quadratic equation.  
Sometimes I create programs for myself again.

I’m currently learning C and C++ for my Arduino's projects and Python as hobby.  
And yet I’m interested in D&D and other board card and role-playing games...
